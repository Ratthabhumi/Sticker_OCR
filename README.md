**Disk Sanitization Assistant** is a desktop application designed to streamline the laptop disk sanitization workflow. It monitors sticker photos of laptop units, automatically extracts the **Serial Number (S/N)** and **Device ID (ID No.)** using **RapidOCR (ONNX Runtime)**, and creates the required destination folder structure `USB:\<SN>(<ID>)\Picture\` on targeted USB drives.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **High-Speed ONNX OCR Engine:** Utilizes RapidOCR for fast, accurate text recognition without external C++ or Heavy AI framework dependencies.
- 💾 **Smart USB Drive Detection & Manual Override:** Automatically detects connected USB Flash Drives and External HDDs, with a live header dropdown selector for manual drive selection when multiple USB devices are connected.
- 🖼️ **Interactive Preview & High-Res Zoom:** Displays an enlarged preview dialog (`860x540`) with full-screen zoom capabilities (`F11` / Double-click) for HD image verification.
- 🧹 **Real-Time Input Sanitization:** Automatically strips illegal OS path characters (`\ / : * ? " < > |`) from S/N and ID inputs in real time to prevent folder creation errors.
- 🔒 **File Lock Race Condition Recovery:** Implements retry loops for image files saved directly from external apps (e.g. LINE PC), featuring a copy-fallback mechanism.
- 🛡️ **Disk Free Space Safety Check:** Verifies available disk space on the target USB drive before initiating folder creation to avoid disk-full errors.
- 📊 **CSV Audit Logging:** Automatically logs daily operational history into CSV audit files located in `Logs/`.
- 🖥️ **Large Display Mode (F11):** High-contrast, large-font fullscreen view for technicians to inspect S/N and ID from a distance.
